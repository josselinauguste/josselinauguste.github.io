## [Piotr Moczurad - Visual-textual functional programming with Luna at LambdaDays 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xUOuzafmO0)

Is Luna is ultimate come back of the visual development paradigm, proposed this time in a functional flavour? In a few words, it is a technology allowing to visually program functional pipelines for data manipulation.

I haven't tried it myself, but I can easily imagine use cases as a visual DSL intended to be used by non-programmers domain exports, to allow them manipulate data on their own.

Here is a Fun Fun Function video showing [Luna in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWzsDPZjOoo), giving us a better visualisation of what may be achievable with the technology.

## [Category theory for programmers by Bartosz Milewski](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_)

A lecture about category theory by Bartosz Milewski, from zero to hero.

Contrary to a lot of content about category theory, this one is really progressive, and very well taught. It lasts several hours, and so represents for the viewer a non-negligible investment in time, but it is worth it (and the running time is surely the reason why it is so progressive: hard things take time to learn!).

## [What we talk about when we talk about monads - Tomas Petricek](http://programming-journal.org/2018/2/12/)

The history of our representations of the concept of monad, as seen by mathematicians and programmers, and the answer to the great question: why does learning what a monad is always seems so hard, even though it is a rather simple construction?

This paper is well written, and dives into the untold part of the monad saga. And even if it claims that it is not a description of what a monad is, it provides one of the finest ways to truly understand what a monad truly is.
